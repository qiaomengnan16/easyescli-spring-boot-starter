= Spring Data for Elasticsearch image:https://jenkins.spring.io/buildStatus/icon?job=spring-data-elasticsearch%2Fmaster&subject=Build[link=https://jenkins.spring.io/view/SpringData/job/spring-data-elasticsearch/] https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[image:https://badges.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data.svg[Gitter]]

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data Elasticsearch project provides integration with the https://www.elastic.co/[Elasticsearch] search engine. Key functional areas of Spring Data Elasticsearch are a POJO centric model for interacting with a Elasticsearch Documents and easily writing a Repository style data access layer.

This project is lead and maintained by the community.

== Features

* Spring configuration support using Java based `@Configuration` classes or an XML namespace for a ES clients instances.
* `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` helper class that increases productivity performing common ES operations. Includes integrated object mapping between documents and POJOs.
* Feature Rich Object Mapping integrated with Spring’s Conversion Service
* Annotation based mapping metadata
* Automatic implementation of `Repository` interfaces including support for custom search methods.
* CDI support for repositories

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Service
public class MyService {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  public MyService(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public void doWork() {

    repository.deleteAll();

    Person person = new Person();
    person.setFirstname("Oliver");
    person.setLastname("Gierke");
    repository.save(person);

    List<Person> lastNameResults = repository.findByLastname("Gierke");
    List<Person> firstNameResults = repository.findByFirstnameLike("Oli");
 }
}
----

=== Using Transport Client

NOTE: Usage of the TransportClient is deprecated as of version 4.0, use RestClient instead.


[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class TransportClientConfig extends ElasticsearchConfigurationSupport {

	@Bean
	public Client elasticsearchClient() throws UnknownHostException {
		Settings settings = Settings.builder().put("cluster.name", "elasticsearch").build();
		TransportClient client = new PreBuiltTransportClient(settings);
		client.addTransportAddress(new TransportAddress(InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1"), 9300));
		return client;
	}

	@Bean(name = { "elasticsearchOperations", "elasticsearchTemplate" })
	public ElasticsearchTemplate elasticsearchTemplate() throws UnknownHostException {
		return new ElasticsearchTemplate(elasticsearchClient());
	}
}
----

=== Using the RestClient

Provide a configuration like this:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class RestClientConfig extends AbstractElasticsearchConfiguration {

    @Override
    @Bean
    public RestHighLevelClient elasticsearchClient() {

        final ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = ClientConfiguration.builder()
            .connectedTo("localhost:9200")
            .build();

        return RestClients.create(clientConfiguration).rest();
    }
}
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-elasticsearch</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

// NOTE: since Github does not support include directives, the content of
// the src/main/asciidoc/reference/preface.adoc file is duplicated here
// Always change both files!
**Compatibility Matrix**

The compatibility between Spring Data Elasticsearch, Elasticsearch client drivers and Spring Boot versions can be found in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/3.2.0.RC3/reference/html/#preface.versions[reference documentation].

To use the Release candidate versions of the upcoming major version, use our Maven milestone repository and declare the appropriate dependency version:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-elasticsearch</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.RCx</version> <!-- x being 1, 2, ... -->
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
</repository>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-elasticsearch</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* If you are upgrading, check out the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/changelog.txt[changelog] for "`new and noteworthy`" features.
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-data[`spring-data-elasticsearch`].
You can also chat with the community on https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[Gitter].
* Report bugs with Spring Data for Elasticsearch at https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAES[jira.spring.io/browse/DATAES].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses JIRA as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAES[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAES[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use JIRA `{code}…{code}` escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before submitting your first pull request._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
